Chapter 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include decision-making, language translation, speech recognition, and visual perception.

Subfields of AI:
1. Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables machines to understand and generate human language.
3. Computer Vision: Allows machines to interpret and process visual information.
4. Expert Systems: Software that mimics the decision-making abilities of a human expert.

Applications of AI:
- Self-driving cars
- Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
- Fraud detection in banking
- Personalized recommendations on Netflix or Amazon

Advantages of AI:
- Increases efficiency and accuracy
- Works in hazardous environments
- Can analyze large datasets quickly

Challenges in AI:
- Ethical concerns
- Job displacement
- Bias in training data this i have notes also
