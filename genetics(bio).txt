Chapter 6: Fundamentals of Genetics

Genetics is the study of heredity and variation in living organisms.

Key Concepts:
- Gene: Basic unit of heredity.
- DNA: Molecule that carries genetic instructions.
- Chromosome: Structure made of DNA and protein.
- Allele: Different forms of a gene.
- Genotype: Genetic makeup of an organism.
- Phenotype: Physical expression of traits.

Mendel’s Laws:
1. Law of Segregation – Each trait is controlled by two alleles, one from each parent.
2. Law of Independent Assortment – Genes for different traits are inherited independently.
3. Law of Dominance – One allele may mask the effect of another.

Applications:
- Genetic engineering
- DNA fingerprinting
- Disease diagnosis
- Crop improvement
