Chapter 2: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning – The model learns from labeled data. Example: Spam email detection.
2. Unsupervised Learning – The model identifies patterns from unlabeled data. Example: Customer segmentation.
3. Reinforcement Learning – The model learns by receiving rewards or penalties for actions. Example: Self-driving cars.

Key Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering
- Neural Networks

Applications:
- Stock Market Prediction
- Image Recognition
- Recommendation Systems
- Speech Recognition

Advantages:
- Can handle large and complex data
- Continuously improves performance
- Reduces human intervention

Challenges:
- Requires high-quality data
- Model interpretability can be difficult
- Risk of overfitting
